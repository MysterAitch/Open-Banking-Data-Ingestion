-- The schema as it SHIPPED at 00902f3 - provenance read as well as written.
-- Kept verbatim so a store created by that release can be built and
-- opened by current code. Never edit a snapshot to make a test pass:
-- the whole point is that it records a shape somebody's store is
-- still carrying, and only a migration can change what happens to it.

-- Keyed on (digest, account_ref, origin), NOT digest alone. Identical bytes
-- from a different request are different EVIDENCE: every empty API body is
-- byte-identical, so a digest-only key would collapse "account A asked for
-- range R, got nothing" across every account and every day into one row -
-- destroying exactly the asked-and-empty facts the origin column exists to
-- preserve. Same bytes from the SAME request remain deduplicated, which is
-- what makes re-importing a download harmless.
